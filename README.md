# Data Science Portfolio

## About Me
Hi, welcome to my portfolio! This portfolio showcases some of the projects I have worked on while pursuing my M.S. in Data Analytics at UMGC. I have worked with different languages and softwares such as Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and SAS Enterprise Miner. These projects have been a mix of solo and group projects, highlighting my ability to work independently and effectively in a team setting. 

Equipped with a strong foundation in scientific principles and analytical thinking; I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Data Analytics (fifth semester). As an astrophysics graduate, I have a passion for data science and analytics. Detail-oriented with strong analytical, problem-solving, and communication skills with experience working in a team structure and as an individual contributor.
